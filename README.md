# simulation-of-A380-elevatator-operation
The aim of this project is to introduce the principles and concept of an aircraft’s elevator operation with the use of simulation models. Considerable simplifications and assumptions are made, and simulations are implemented on the bases of these simplifications. This project would depict the A380 elevator’s model structure, geometry, dynamics, actuator and PID controller. The computations and model analysis of our simulations are made In the MATLAB &amp; SIMULINK software.
